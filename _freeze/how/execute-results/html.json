And I only need a simple static website, but I want to be able to update the information about my research publications and things I've made and done (aka Projects) relatively easily which isn't functionality that is built into Quarto at the time of writing.\n\nI looked around at what others had done and wanted to know how others had dealt with publications and research (@sec-journal-articles-page), which led me to this Github issues page: <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/1324>\n\nAfter a bit of further browsing of the excellent sites linked from the Github issues, I decided that John Paul Helveston's (JPH) approach was what I needed. His repo: <https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy_quarto> and his site: <https://jhelvy.com/>\n\nAdditionally, there were a few bits of styling I wanted for an academic website, icons in particular (@sec-homepage-and-icons). So for (future) reference I've collated what I did here beyond following the [Quarto website documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) to customise things.\n\nThe Github repo for my website is: <https://github.com/ab604/academic-website-2024>\n\n## Set-up and YAML {#sec-set-up-and-yaml}\n\nTo add things not include by default in a Quarto such as `css` styling, or a directory for my CV, use the `resources` section of `project:` in the `_quarto.yml` as below. Here the character vectors refer to directories and their contents, but they could also be individual files.\n\n``` yaml\nresources:\n    - \"css\"\n    - \"cv\"\n```\n\nOn the navigation, my CV links to a separate webpage that's built from a spreadsheet, which is added via the `resources` above and then the file is linked to using `href` and I use `target: _blank` to ensure it opens in a new tab/window.\n\n``` yaml\n- text: CV\n  href: cv/cv.html\n  target: _blank\n```\n\nQuarto use bootstrap icons, but this set doesn't have all the icons I wanted and JPH has an `_includes` folder has a bit of `html` to load fontawesome icons, so I added that to my site too.\n\n``` yaml\n# This is to include fontawesome and academic icons in the headers:\n    include-in-header: \"_includes/header.html\"\n```\n\nEverything else I've customised in the `_quarto.yml` is pretty well documented in the [Quarto yaml html docs](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html).\n\n## Homepage and icons {#sec-homepage-and-icons}\n\nFor [my homepage](https://ab604.uk){.external target=\"_blank\"} I went with an [about page with hero heading](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html) using the `solana` template which is set in the page YAML of the `index.qmd` file:\n\n``` yaml\n---\ntitle: My Name\nabout:\n  id: hero-heading\n  template: solana\n  image: \"img/avatar.jpg\"\n  image-shape: round\n  image-width: 13em\n  links:\n    - text: \"{{< iconify fa6-brands:bluesky size=2em title='Bluesky'>}}\"\n      aria-label: \"Bluesky\"\n      href: https://bsky.app/profile/profile-name.bsky.social\n      target: _blank\n---\n```\n\nFor link icons I installed the iconify extension: <https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-iconify> by MickaÃ«l Canouil using:\n\n``` bash\nquarto add mcanouil/quarto-iconify\n```\n\nThen search for your icon of interest on <https://icon-sets.iconify.design/> and then use the `text` field with a shortcode in quotes such as the one above for Bluesky `\"{{< iconify fa6-brands:bluesky size=2em title='Bluesky'>}}\"`. Note that I set `target: _blank` to make it open in a new tab/window.\n\nBelow the YAML is the `:::{#hero-heading}` container with my text and also some icons from iconify again. The shortcodes don't need quotes when used in-line. Iused a bit of in-line `html` for to tweak the formatting.\n\n``` markdown\n:::{#hero-heading}\n\n### Biography\n\nMy biography\n\n### Interests\n\nMy interests\n\n### Education\n\n{{< iconify lets-icons:mortarboard-light size=1.75em title=\"PhD i\" >}} PhD <br>University of Somewhere\n\n{{< iconify lets-icons:mortarboard-light size=1.75em title=\"BEng\">}} BEng i<br>University of Somewhere\n\n{{< iconify lets-icons:mortarboard-light size=1.75em title=\"BTEC ND\">}} BTEC ND<br>College of Art & Design\n\n:::\n```\n\n## Fonts and styles {#sec-fonts-and-styles}\n\nFor fonts and styles I created a `scss` files in the `css` folder. The ones on my site have been hacked a lot, so they probably contain redundant code.\n\nFor free fonts, choose whatever you like from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and then click get code and embed and then the select the import radio button and copy the code to the top of your `scss` file.\n\nHere's Roboto - you don't need the `<style>` tags.\n\n![](images/clipboard-4074932312.png)\n\nThen you have to define which fonts you want to use for the various bits of the document. For example this would set the headings to use Roboto.\n\n``` css\n// Set Heading font to Roboto\n$headings-font-family: 'Roboto';\n```\n\nI'll leave it to the reader to explore the rest and colours etc., but I have made some notes on font size and choices in the guide I made for how to [design for text and links webpages](https://ab604.github.io/webpage-design/){.external target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nI also wanted a dark and light theme, so I have one `scss` file for each that augments the in-built `cosmo` styles called in the format section of the `_quarto.yml` :\n\n``` yaml\ntheme:\n      dark:\n      - cosmo\n      - css/dark.scss\n      light:\n      - cosmo\n      - css/styles.scss\n```\n\nTo style the icons on the homepage I inspected the page for where the icons were styled and then added code to override it to my `scss` files. You'll need to do this for both dark and light `scss` files.\n\n``` css\ndiv.quarto-about-solana .about-entity .about-link {\n    //background-color: white;\n    color: $primary-color;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    font-weight: 600;\n    border: none;\n    //border-color: $primary-color;\n}\n\ndiv.quarto-about-solana .about-entity .about-link:hover {\n    color: $neutral2;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    font-weight: 600;\n    border: none;\n    //border-color: $secondary-color;\n}\n```\n\nLastly I copied over `strapless.css` from JPH's site to work with his `_common.R` functions for my publications page.\n\n## Publications page {#sec-journal-articles-page}\n\nHaving settled on John Paul Helveston's approach of creating a spreadsheet that I can update and is then read and updates the Publications page on my site.\n\nThis is similar to how I maintain my CV (<https://github.com/ab604/abailey-cv>) forked from Nick Strayer's repo: <https://github.com/nstrayer/cv> and also uses a spreadsheet.\n\nFor the website I took the `_common.R` file from JPH's Github repo which contains all the functions he wrote for reading a Google sheet and formatting it as a webpage (which uses fontawesome icons, hence needing them in the header) and adapted to use with my own Google sheet.\n\nEssentially I made it a bit simpler as I'm only interested in publications and not other types of activity and functionality that JPH has added. Here is a [Google Sheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eBPmTGxFttdxKFUCVoIkK1_Tt4vx4R1pt-W-8pZ8-hI/edit?usp=sharing) that will work with the `_common.R` file.\n\nAs mentioned in @sec-fonts-and-styles, I also needed the `strapless.css` file for styling and the `header.html` for the fontawesome icons (@sec-set-up-and-yaml).\n\nThen I created a Quarto file using JPH's original with the code below containing:\n\n-   The document YAML\n\n-   Some in-line `css` to remove the divider lines between articles.\n\n-   Then a R chunk to source `_common.R` and read the Google Sheet, followed by some in-line R to print the journal articles using the `make_pub_list()` function from `_common.R`.\n\n``` markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Publications\"\ndescription: I am joint first author on all work with Ben Nicholas. \n---\n\n<!-- Remove margin under list items -->\n\n<style>\nol {\n    margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\np {\n  margin: 5px 0 0 0;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsource(\"_common.R\")\n\n# Get pubs from Google sheet\npubs <- get_pubs()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n`` `r make_pub_list(pubs, 'peer_reviewed')` ``\n\nOne note is that it won't refresh the articles from the Google Sheet unless I edit `.qmd` file too. (Add a space, remove a space.)\n\n## Bits and pieces\n\n-   If you need to force a link to open in a new tab/page, adding `{.external target=\"_blank\"}` after the link in source mode will do it.\n\n-   If you want your own icon in the tab, this is set in the `favicon` property in the `website` section of the `_quarto.yml` . Make a 512x512 pixel `ico` file. I used Illustrator to save an image as `.png` and then changed the file extension to `.ico` .\n\n    ``` yaml\n    favicon: image.ico\n    ```\n\n### Netlify\n\nI push to Github and then to Netlify as described here: <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html#publish-from-git-provider>\n",
