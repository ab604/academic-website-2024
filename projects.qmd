## Bluesky literature bot

[![](img/hla-black.png){fig-alt="HLA molecule" width="50" height="90"}](https://bsky.app/profile/protpapers.bsky.social)

Based on the bots of [\@roblanfear.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:kvlugcsdfxrn7bidtfzwusez) and [\@jbgruber.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/jbgruber.bsky.social) I created a bot using R and Github actions to post journal articles published on PubMed and bioRxiv that are of interest to me to keep up with the literature. You can make your own.
