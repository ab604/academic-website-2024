## Work in progress bot {#sec-work-in-progress-bot}

![](images/fluent-emoji-high-contrast--man.png){width="100"}

Another Bluesky bot: [\@wkipbot.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/wkipbot.bsky.social)

I enjoy reading [Work in Progress](https://worksinprogress.co), but each article is long (20 to 40 minutes reading) and I often forget about an issue once it’s published. Each issue has 6 or 7 articles.

So to help me keep up, I created a Bluesky bot to post a link and description of one of the 115 articles (at the time of writing) from the Work in Progress archive each week with a screenshot.

## Our World in Data bot {#sec-our-world-in-data-bot}

![](images/bafkreia3nyjtyw4sffxdlrfhzmn4suhsfpdhia2dzbq4zy5cpidiqrr3ai.jpg){width="100"}

A bot that posts a screen shot of the Our World in Data (OWID) Daily Data Insight to Bluesky: [\@owid-daily-data.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/owid-daily-data.bsky.social)

It's built upon Simon Willison’s GitHub [shot-scraper template](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-template) repository that takes an automated screenshot of a OWID Daily Data Insight web page using [shot-scraper](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper). I then wrote a short R script to get alt-text and links and create the post for Bluesky.

The bot runs using Github Actions `yml` as a `cron` job similar to my literature bot (@sec-bluesky-literature-bot).

My Github repo is here: <https://github.com/ab604/owid-dd-bot>

## Bluesky literature bot {#sec-bluesky-literature-bot}

[![](img/hla-black.png){fig-alt="HLA molecule" width="56"}](https://bsky.app/profile/protpapers.bsky.social)

Based on the bots of [\@roblanfear.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:kvlugcsdfxrn7bidtfzwusez) and [\@jbgruber.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/jbgruber.bsky.social) I created a bot using R and Github actions to post journal articles published on PubMed and bioRxiv that are of interest to me to keep up with the literature. You can make your own.

![Mathematical model of MHC peptide selection](img/sci-rep-mhc-model.png){fig-alt="Diagram of a mathematical model of MHC peptide selection" width="390"}

This project sought to explain the mechanism of peptide selection by two functionally distinct MHC I allotypes using a combination of molecular dynamics and mathematical modelling of biochemical experiments.

In collaboration with the Biological Computation Group at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) we used biochemical data to infer that a conformational intermediate of MHC I is significant for peptide selection, and molecular dynamics simulations to show that peptide selector function correlates with protein plasticity.

This led to the proposal that MHC I cofactor tapasin modulates MHC I plasticity by dynamically coupling the peptide binding region and membrane bound domain.
