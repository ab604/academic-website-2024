## Bluesky literature bot

[![](img/hla-black.png){fig-alt="HLA molecule" width="56"}](https://bsky.app/profile/protpapers.bsky.social)

Based on the bots of [\@roblanfear.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:kvlugcsdfxrn7bidtfzwusez) and [\@jbgruber.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/jbgruber.bsky.social) I created a bot using R and Github actions to post journal articles published on PubMed and bioRxiv that are of interest to me to keep up with the literature. You can make your own.

## The Itchen Bridge: Construction in colour

A local history project created with our intern Pardeep Panesar and the Digital Scholarship team at the University of Southampton. The results are on our [Itchen Bridge webpage](https://ab604.github.io/itchen-bridge/).

## Selector function of MHC I molecules is determined by protein plasticity 2015

![Mathematical model of MHC peptide selection](img/sci-rep-mhc-model.png){fig-alt="Diagram of a mathematical model of MHC peptide selection"}

This project sought to explain the mechanism of peptide selection by two functionally distinct MHC I allotypes using a combination of molecular dynamics and mathematical modelling of biochemical experiments.

In collaboration with the Biological Computation Group at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) we used biochemical data to infer that a conformational intermediate of MHC I is significant for peptide selection, and molecular dynamics simulations to show that peptide selector function correlates with protein plasticity.

This led to the proposal that MHC I cofactor tapasin modulates MHC I plasticity by dynamically coupling the peptide binding region and membrane bound domain.
